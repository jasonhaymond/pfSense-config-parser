# pfconfig-to-docx
Monitor folder(s) for pfSense XML config files and parse them into a word DOCX file.
Can be used manually, or with a scheduled task or cron job.

Thanks to TKCERT for the parsing module used in my script. It can be found and downloaded here: https://github.com/TKCERT/pfFocus/tree/master.
