# pfconfig-to-docx
Monitor folder(s) for pfSense XML config files and parse them into a word DOCX file.
Can be used manually, or with a scheduled task.

Assumes running on Windows with Python, Pypandoc installed and added to PATH, and the below pfFocus module installed.

Thanks to TKCERT for the parsing module pfFocus that I used in my script. It can be found and downloaded here: https://github.com/TKCERT/pfFocus/tree/master.
